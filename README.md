# DisTalk Chat App

## Aim
This project is a **real-time chat application** that allows multiple users to communicate seamlessly over the internet. It consists of two main components: a **client application**, which runs in the user's web browser, and a **server application**, which operates on a hosting server to manage connections and message broadcasting. The application provides a smooth and interactive chatting experience by displaying real-time messages, keeping track of active users, and notifying when users join or leave the chat. Additionally, it incorporates an **abuse masking feature** that automatically filters out offensive words, replacing them with asterisks (`****`) to maintain a respectful conversation environment. Powered by **Socket.io**, this chat application ensures fast and efficient bi-directional communication, making it an ideal platform for real-time discussions while promoting a positive and engaging user experience.
